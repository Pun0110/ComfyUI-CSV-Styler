# CSV Styler

Repository contains CSV Styler - custom node for ComfyUI. The provided positive and negative prompts are processed according to selected style (styles parsed from `styles.csv` - [Automatic1111 Web-Ui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) like format).

`styles.csv` should be placed in ComfyUI root directory (near `main.py`).

`styles.csv` with over 200+ styles are in [Automatic1111-Fooocus-Styles](https://github.com/thundercat71/Automatic1111-Fooocus-Styles) repo. Unfortunately __it contains some typos__, so there [fork with fixes](https://github.com/Pun0110/Automatic1111-Fooocus-Styles-fixes)

## Usage example

Provide positive and negative prompts in your preffered way and select necessary style. `{prompt}` keyworld in style is also taken into account.
